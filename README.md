# web-beep

Just a little web app to play `beep` terminal songs. I found it very difficult to install https://github.com/johnath/beep and get it working with my speakers, so I made a browser version.

This tool attempts to run bash song scripts by only providing support for simple constants and no looping. This should work fine for most songs.
